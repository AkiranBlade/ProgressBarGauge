# Progress Bar Gauge

The progress bar gauge allows users to open a guage image (one provided by default) which sits as TopMost on the users screen allowing them to get a more accurate measurement on a progress bar that gives no information.

** * NOTE - User may need to 'Unblock' the zip archive before extracting the contents otherwise the application may not run. **

Once running you can grab the gauge by holding down the left mouse button on the right pointing arrow and simplay dragging the gauge into position.

To close the guage app, you will need to do this from the windows taskbar as this is a very basic app in nature.

Users can customize the gauge image by editing the config.json file in the extracted directory.
